### Care Pathway Overview

ERAS@Home stands for Enhanced Recovery After Surgery @ Home. Tthe project primarily focuses on colorectal surgery. It has two main objectives:
- To better prepare patients for surgeryâ€”both physically (through physiotherapy and nutritional guidance) and mentally (by providing clear information about the procedure, hospitalisation, discharge process, and how to prepare the home environment for recovery).
- To enable earlier discharge from the hospital by ensuring the patient is well-prepared and remains safely connected to the care team through remote monitoring.

After surgery, a remote monitoring app keeps the patient and hospital in close contact during the first few weeks of recovery. This allows for remote follow-up, early detection of potential issues, and personalised advice delivered through the app.
By reducing unnecessary hospital days and supporting safe recovery at home, the project improves hospital efficiency and helps alleviate staffing pressures.

### Process and Workflow Description

#### Start-Up

- **Informed consent**: Collected and securely stored.
- **Parameters Monitored**:
    - Blood Pressure (BP)
    - Heart Rate (HR)
    - Oxygen Saturation (SPO2)
    - Respiratory Rate
    - General Wellbeing (NRS)
    - Pain Surgical Wound (NRS)
    - Nausea (NRS)
    - Food Intake
    - Stool
    - Redon
    - Weight (BW)
    - Remarks HCP (free text)

#### Data Collection

- Data is manually entered into the system by patient or health care provider.
- Technology is CE-certified, with end-to-end encryption and GDPR compliance.

### Integration Modules for EPD

#### Outcome Module - FHIR Integration

##### General

- **Frequency**: Maximum of 5 updates per day, on average 1 update per day (per measurement).
- **LOINC and SNOMED CT Codes**:
